to autodoc/generate templates:
run in spr-web: sphinx-apidoc -f -o source/ stockportfolio/ stockportfolio/api/migrations stockportfolio/settings


to build the html pages:
make html . BUILDDIR="docs/"   (replace BUILDDIR as needed, the actual html pages are located in BUILDDIR/html)


To document your methods (example):

def get_stock_data(symbol, start_date=None, end_date=None):
    """
    Get OHLC stock data from Yahoo Finance for a single stock

    :param symbol: (string)
    :param start_date: (DateTime)
    :param end_date: (DateTime)
    :return: (DataFrame) of stock data from start_date to end_date
    """

IMPORTANT: make sure there is an extra space after the method description and your param/return args!!! OTHERWISE
SPHINX WILL NOT WORK PROPERLJY
